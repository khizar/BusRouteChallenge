# BusRouteChallenge
Coding challenge for GoEuro.


## Problem! File Watcher
The File watcher is not the greatest piece of code you will ever see. It watches the folder for changes and different text editors handle text changes differently, so sometimes it reloads twice which is fine for the small dataset for development but might run into problems when there is lots of data to reload. TODO: Find a better solution or fine tune it for all situations.

### Task

The bus route data file provided by the bus provider contains a list of bus
routes. These routes consist of an unique identifier and a list of stations
(also just unique identifiers). A bus route **connects** its list of stations.

Your task is to implement a micro service which is able to answer whether there
is a bus route providing a direct connection between two given stations. *Note:
The station identifiers given in a query may not be part of any bus route!*


### Bus Route Data

The first line of the data gives you the number **N** of bus routes, followed by
**N** bus routes. For each bus route there will be **one** line containing a
space separated list of integers. This list contains at least three integers. The
**first** integer represents the bus **route id**. The bus route id is unique
among all other bus route ids in the input. The remaining integers in the list
represent a list of **station ids**. A station id may occur in multiple bus
routes, but can never occur twice within the same bus route.

You may assume 100,000 as upper limit for the number of bus routes, 1,000,000 as
upper limit for the number of stations, and 1,000 as upper limit for the number
of station of one bus route. Therefore, your internal data structure should
still fit into memory on a suitable machine.

*Note: The bus route data file will be a local file and your service will get
the path to file as the first command line argument. Your service will get
restarted if the file or its location changes.*


### REST API

Your micro service has to implement a REST-API supporting a single URL and only
GET requests. It has to serve
`http://localhost:8088/api/direct?dep_sid={}&arr_sid={}`. The parameters
`dep_sid` (departure) and `arr_sid` (arrival) are two station ids (sid)
represented by 32 bit integers.

The response has to be a single JSON Object:

```
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "dep_sid": {
      "type": "integer"
    },
    "arr_sid": {
      "type": "integer"
    },
    "direct_bus_route": {
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "dep_sid",
    "arr_sid",
    "direct_bus_route"
  ]
}
```

The `direct_bus_route` field has to be set to `true` if there exists a bus route
in the input data that connects the stations represented by `dep_sid` and
`arr_sid`. Otherwise `direct_bus_route` must be set to `false`.




### Example Data

Bus Routes Data File:
```
3
0 0 1 2 3 4
1 3 1 6 5
2 0 6 4
```

Query:
````
http://localhost:8088/api/direct?dep_sid=3&arr_sid=6
```

Response:
```
{
    "dep_sid": 3,
    "arr_sid": 6,
    "direct_bus_route": true
}
```
